Quantum Mechanics Simulation
This demonstrates Quantum Mechanics and makes it much easier for the user to be able to visualize quantum systems at the scale of a human eye. There are many intended features in this code, including but not limited to;
- Plotting different aspects about a quantum system (primarily distance, time, and energy)
- Different plotting methods

This is a demonstration piece of code. This code is not complete, however I intend to finish it. It is currently approximately ~2500 lines, and it will likely grow and shrink over time, eventually settling around ~3000 lines.

My personal choice with this code was not to make it an object-oriented dependent code, instead relying on functions to perform what objects do. That said, libraries will perform some object-oriented activities. The list of libraries is currently longer than it needs to be on purpose, however it will be shorter in future versions of code.

The code is in a development stage, it has at least 4 critical bugs.
